# EmLab Amp HW
Hardware for 70dB amp

## Notes
- digital and analog parts should be shielded from each other
- might be worth to create separate power rails for digital and analog
- main PSU should be inspired by [USBSymC5V symetric PSU](https://github.com/LoaDy588/USBCSym5V)

## TODO
- talk to Tom(the SW guy)
- talk to Samo(Analog)
- `General` - need to solve KiCAD library sharing between computers
- look into proper USB stuff
